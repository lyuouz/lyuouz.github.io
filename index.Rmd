Hi I'm Lyuou! I am a student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I currenty live in New York. 

I am studying environmental health sciences. I am interested in doing research on topics such as air pollution, energy and sustainability. 

Outside of schoolwork, I enjoy drawing, photography and music. Let me know if you have a similar interest!
